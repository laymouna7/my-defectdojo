1. Zipped Report Import

    Implemented support for importing .zip and .tar.gz archives.

    Automatic extraction of contained reports with per-file validation before processing.

    Simplifies bulk report handling and streamlines multi-file imports.

2. Large File Handling

    Added chunked upload processing for very large scan files.

    Introduced a configurable size limit via settings.SCAN_FILE_MAX_SIZE.

    Improves stability and prevents timeouts or memory issues during upload.

3. Report Templates

    Enhanced serializers to support structured report data handling.

    Created a new Custom Engagement Report:

        Added template custom_report.html for engagement-level reporting.

        Integrated with a dedicated view (custom_report_view) and URL route.

        Cleaned up non-functional buttons (removed “Print/Save PDF” & “Back”).

        Linked into the UI (engagement.html, view_engagements.html) for easy access.

4. Nessus Scan Import

    Integrated support for .nessus files.

    Case-insensitive extension validation for more reliable imports.

    Fully integrated into the standard DefectDojo scan import pipeline.

5. Rapid7 Scan Import

    Added support for Rapid7 XML scan reports.

    Handled through the existing standardized import workflow.

    Ensures findings are parsed and mapped consistently across tools.
